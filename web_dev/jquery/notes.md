**JQuery study plan**
====

Since I know some jQuery, I will also include JSON to the task so that I accomplish the aim of the release. I would follow the following sequentially.
1. Find a good cheat sheet. Have a look at the cheat sheet. 
2. Use the power of Google  to find how a particular method/event etc might be used when ever necessary.
3. Use youtube , I am more of a visual learner, I learn much quickly from video tutorials.
4. I will stop every half an hour to try out what I have learned. 
5. I will think of or take as a challenge (not necessary my own unique idea), and try to implement it.
6. I am adding the file after doing it, therefore the above steps already work for me in many of my studies that I did before including jQuery.

*The task I have selected is use a jason file that contains data for countries of the world. Use this data to create a drop down menue to select a country.  For the submission of the assignment, I will live it at this stage but the project can further be extended.*

NB. If the project works with firefox web browser, chrome does not run json off line.
